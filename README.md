# Chiseled Bookshelf Visualizer

The **Chiseled Bookshelf Visualizer** is a Minecraft mod that adds a new gaming experience by providing you with a visual way to identify the contents of the Chiseled Bookshelves.

## Highlights:
- **Intuitive Viewing**: With this mod installed, you will now be able to instantly see the contents of a Chiseled Bookshelf right under your crosshairs. You will no longer have to guess what type of book is in it.
- **Automatic sorting**: The mod distinguishes between all books (normal books, enchanted books and feathered books), making it even easier to manage your library in the game.
- **Easy selection**: With clear information about the contents of each shelf, you can quickly select the book you need without having to check each shelf manually.

## Notice
The mod works in single player and if you want to play in multiplayer, the mod must also be installed on the server (Fabric server).

### Info
    This mod is forked from the original mod by [lukasabbe](https://github.com/lukasabbe/bookshelf-inspector)
